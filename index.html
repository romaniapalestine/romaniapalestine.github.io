<h1>Palestina Este Romania!</h1>
<p>Notice how &quot;Palestine&quot; uses the letter &quot;P&quot;, which isn't in Arabic? That's because the Roman Empire conquered so-called Palestine until it fell. Then the Eastern Roman Empire inherited this land. As the only Eastern European country that speaks a Latin language, Romania is the rightful successor to the Eastern Roman Empire. Please, help us repatriate Romanian Palestine to its rightful Romanian owners.</p>
